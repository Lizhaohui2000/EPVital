This is the code for vital signs monitoring in real time with your eaprhones. Your can simply build such a system by sticking the speaker and microphone of your earphone to a standing book, plugging your earphone to your PC, 
and running our matlab code. The speaker transmits frequency-division-multiple signals can analyze the . Our code can construct the curves of respiration and heartbeat in real time. 

Because the power of off-the shelf speaker in earphone is usually in $1mW-50mW$, this level of sound pressure is hard to satisfy long range monitoring. 
The relationship between the operating distance and error of BPM is shown in: . We believe the operating distance should by less than $1m$. 

We have tested our system with three types of earphones and on Windows and Mac. We believe our system can run at many PCs with 3.5mm audio plug and with many off-the-shelf wired 3.5mm earphones. 
If you want a further operating distance  and accuracy, you can buy our made device. It only costs ï¿¥10.
